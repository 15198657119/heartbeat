Project Description
---------------------------------------

The Application Heartbeats framework provides a simple, standardized way for
applications to monitor their performance and make that information available
to external observers. The framework allows programmers to express their
application's goals and the progress that it is making using a simple API.
This progress can then be observed by either the application itself or an
external system (such as the OS or another application) so that the application
or system can be adapted to make sure the goals are met.


Getting Started
---------------------------------------

1. You can download Heartbeats from:
  http://code.google.com/p/heartbeats/downloads/list
2. Once you have downloaded your copy of the Heartbeats framework you just have to
unzip it:
  unzip heartbeatsapi-VX.Y.zip
or:
  tar -xzvf heartbeatsapi-VX.Y.tar.gz
3. At this point you are ready to start to use the Heartbeats framework. You can:
3.1 Take a look to the documentation (see "Documentation for Heartbeats")
3.2 Familiarize yourself with the Heartbeats API using our examples (see "Testing
Heartbeats")
3.3 Start to use the Application Heartbeats into your own applications
3.4 Get in touch with us and let us know your feedbacks, criticisms, suggestions
(send us an email or join our Heartbeats google group at:
http://groups.google.com/group/heartbeatsapi)

|-doc/    -- Documentation
  |-html  -- Documentation in HTML format

Documentation for Heartbeats
---------------------------------------

The documentation for the Heartbeats framework has been created with
Doxygen.  You can find both an HTML and Latex version of the
documentation in the latest release of the Heartbeats framework.  If,
for any reasons, you need to recreate the documentation by yourself,
you just have to use the following command (use it from the root
directory of the Heartbeats framework):

  doxygen heartbeats_doc



Environment Variables for Heartbeats
------------------------------------

In the Heartbeats framework, Heartbeat-enabled applications signal
their presence to the rest of the world by writing a file to a special
directory.  Currently, this directory is specified by an environment
variable: HEARTBEAT_ENABLED_DIR.  Before running the tests, users
should define this variable to point to a directory in which they have
read and write permissions.


Testing Heartbeats
---------------------------------------

The latest release of the Heartbeats framework comes with a set of
available tests that can be used to familiarize yourself with this
API. You can run one of our two examples, using the following command
(use it from the root directory of the Heartbeats framework):

  make bench-tp

to use the throughput example, or

  make bench-lat

to use the latency example
